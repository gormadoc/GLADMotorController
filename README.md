# GLADMotorController
For controlling a GLAD system motor controller.

# Non-base packages needed:
  * PySerial
  * PyQt5
  
# Goals
The software packaged with the MC was just a text terminal for entering in machine commands over serial. 
It is easy to enter incorrect commands when controlling in real-time and scripting is somewhat arcane.
This project is intended to entirely replace as much of that software as possible and to make scripting easy, as well as to extend it with commonly used functionality
